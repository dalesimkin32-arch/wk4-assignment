Got database running by redoing whole env variable and inserting newly changed password.

CLient ONLY showing the form (default html) Fri 26/09/2025 20:05

manually added workable image data to DB, so could css page better.
manually changed sql table for 1984 to be for Ready Player One - because
CSS adjusted for main page layout and then
adjusted to show better on mobile screens

Added ARIA to html where it would help.
adjusted form css a bit (seems to adjust ok to screen size change, so not thinking more needed)
added form handling .js (not tested)

- will test more tomorrow.
