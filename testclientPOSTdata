A race for survival among the stars... Humanity's last survivors escaped earth's ruins to find a new home. But when they find it, can their desperation overcome its dangers? WHO WILL INHERIT THIS NEW EARTH?
The novel is praised for its imaginative scope, thought-provoking themes of humanity, religion, and civilization, and its masterful world-building. Some readers found the character development limited by the story's vast timescale.

Air
Geoff Ryman
9780575076976
Air explores a world where a new, pervasive information technology called "Air" connects minds without machines or power. When a test run of Air in a small, remote village goes disastrously wrong, the local fashion expert, Mae Chung, is flooded with memories from a deceased neighbor, leaving her disoriented but uniquely positioned to help her community navigate the radical changes Air brings.
Geoff Ryman's novel is a thoughtful and intimate look at the transformative power of information and technology, focusing on ordinary people in a non-Western context rather than the technology itself. While many praise Ryman's intricate characterization of Mae Chung and his ability to convey the complexities of a changing world, some readers found the depiction of the symbolic subversion of Mae's pregnancy to be jarring and offensive.
